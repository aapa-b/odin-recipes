		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This recipe comes from the south of Italy, where lamb is simply roasted, with garlic and wild mountain herbs.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1,5kg of lamb leg</li>
			<li>2-4 spoons olive oil</li>
			<li>4 garlic cloves, cut in half</li>
			<li>2 branches of fresh sage</li>
			<li>2 little branches of dried rosemary</li>
			<li>2 bay leaves</li>
			<li>2 branches of fresh thyme</li>
			<li>3/4 cups dry white wine</li>
			<li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
			<li>fresh herbs for garnish</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Remove all fat excess. Spread with oil. Make small cuts in the skin and put garlic in some and herbs on the others.</li>
			<li>Put the rest of the herbs above the lamb and leave it in a fresh place for at least 2 hours before cooking it. Preheat the oven at 190ÂºC.</li>
			<li>Put the lamb on a big oven plate around herbs. Spread two tablespoons of olive oil above it, season it with salt and pepper. Roast it for 35 minutes, spreading its own juice above it.</li>
			<li>Pour the wine above the lamb. Roast it 15 minutes or until it's done. Put it on a tray that can resist the heat, tilt it and remove the fat with a spoon, you can use it for making a sauce. Cut the meat and serve it separated from the juices. Garnish with fresh herbs.</li>
